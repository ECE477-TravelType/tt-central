* TravelType - ECE 477 Spring 2021 - Team 2
TravelType is a semi-wireless, portable, split ergonomic keyboard. This is the firmware for the wired "central" module. It is intended to be run on an STM32L053R8Tx microcontroller.

Its purpose is to receive keypresses via BLE from the halves, and translate them into keycodes to be sent over USB to a computer.
** Building
Compilation requires the [[https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads][ARM GCC]] toolchain and [[https://sourceware.org/newlib/][Newlib]] embedded libc. Make sure ~arm-none-eabi-gcc~ and ~arm-none-eabi-objcopy~ are in your path. Simply run ~make~ in this directory to compile everything; binaries will be in ~build/~.
** Flashing
Flashing requires [[http://openocd.org/getting-openocd/][OpenOCD]], and debugging also requires ~arm-none-eabi-gdb~, which should be included with your ARM GCC toolchain. To flash, run ~make run~.
